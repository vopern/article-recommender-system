# Frontend UI

A smiple UI build with streamlit. A user can  
- Get recommendations 
- Search the arxiv with a custom query

To improve future recommendations
- Clicks on results and clickouts to the article on the arxiv are tracked.

Users are required to enter their id manually. Instead there should be just a user management so one can login to the service.
